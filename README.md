# What is Moonwalk?

While designing websites, Lauren was plagued at every turn by columns of unequal height! Sometimes, a page's content was much too long for a designâ€”other times, the sidebar would grow to disproportionately ugly lengths. Determined to find a solution to this problem, Lauren booted her laptop, rolled up her sleeves, opened the jQuery reference website, and got to work.

What came of her labors is this: Moonwalk. Designed as a complete replacement for the way a webpage _scrolls_, Moonwalk can move each column of a page __independently__ of another, in parallax. When you reach the bottom of one column, for example, _every other column_ has also reached the bottom, regardless of each column's actual length. This is done by scrolling each column at a different speed, and treating the webpage like a vertical version of an old 16-bit adventure game's background scenery.
